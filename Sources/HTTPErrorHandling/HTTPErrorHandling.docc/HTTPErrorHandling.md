# ``HTTPErrorHandling``

Interpret HTTP responses and handle failures.

## Overview

In the HTTP protocol, a client sends a request to a server and the server sends a response back to the client. The response contains a [status code](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes) to help the client interpret the response.

HTTP libraries like `Foundation` pass the response through to the caller without interpreting the response as a success or failure. `HTTPErrorHandling` can help the caller interpret HTTP responses and handle failures.

The module works with any HTTP library that is compatible with Swiftâ€™s [standard HTTP request and response types](https://github.com/apple/swift-http-types). The module can be used on its own in code that directly uses an HTTP library, or the module can be used as a building block by higher-level networking libraries.
