import HTTPTypes

/// Adds `RetryableRequest` conformance to `HTTPRequest`.
///
/// The `RetryableRequest` conformance adds safe retry methods to `HTTPRequest`.
///
/// - Important: The retry methods accept a closure that attempts the request. The closure must interpret the response
///    and throw ``HTTPApplicationError`` when the response represents a failure. Calling
///    ``HTTPTypes/HTTPResponse/throwIfFailed(successStatuses:transientFailureStatuses:)``
///    is a convenient way to do so.
///
/// The `recoverFromFailure` closure is not called when the failure is due to ``HTTPApplicationError``. The
/// retry method implementations automatically choose a recovery action for ``HTTPApplicationError`` using
/// HTTP-specific information including whether the error is transient and the value of the `Retry-After` header,
/// if present.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [`Retry`](https://fumoboy007.github.io/swift-retry/documentation/retry/)
